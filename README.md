# Layout Helper

I thought it would be a good idea to get a blank keyboard for my laptop and im really questioning it now. Install by cloning the repo and running `pip install .` and moving everything from the layouts directory to .config/Layout_Helper

I couldn't figure out how to get pip to put the layouts in .config so I gave up and you have to do that yourself
